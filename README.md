Mashable News Analysis

When technology changed the ways of we consume news and information, media and entertainment companies start publishing more news and articles on the digital platform through web and internet. Mashable news data set makes me excited to mine those rich and deep information regarding online articles and predict popularity and market shares of a given article.

1. What is the problem you want to solve?
   - Why some articles are more popular than others  
   - What types of articles gain more attraction at a given time
   - Create a predictive model that can help the media company to publish the best-targeted online articles  
2. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn't have otherwise?
   - Mashable or potential other media companies to gain some insight about news readers' mind
   - Improve the online media content based on the popularity
   - Adapt a better publising strategy
3. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
   - Mashable online news data set from [UCI Machine Learning Repositary](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity). There are total 39797 data entries and 61 attributes, including  58 predictive attributes, 2 non-predictive, 1 goal field.
4. In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (kowing that this might change later).
   - Getting the data: I will download the data set from [UCI Machine Learning Repositary](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).
   - Exploratory data anlysis: I will explore the data and try to find out if there is any correlation or pattern between the predictive attributes and the target attribute.
   - Predictive model: I will build a model to predict how popular a given article will be based on those predictive attributes. 
5. What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.
   - Code, analysis, visualizations and model
   - Report/slide deck
